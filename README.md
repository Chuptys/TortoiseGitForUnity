# About TortoiseGit for Unity
This package extends the Unity Editor UI with handy function calls to TortoiseGit functions.

## Prerequisites
For the package to work correct, the user needs to have TortoiseGit installed.
See https://tortoisegit.org/ for more details on the TortoiseGit installation process.

## Usage
1. Inside the Unity Editor, open the TortoiseGitForUnity tool using **Tools/TortoiseGit for Unity**
2. When the tool opens, it scans the parent directory of the current Unity project and every subdirectory of the 'Assets' and 'Packages' folders. Found repositories are listed in the dropdown menu.
3. To Commit/Fetch or show the log of a repository, first select the desired repository from the dropdown of discovered repositories. Then, click the appropriate action button.
